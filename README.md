# ***Pet Guide***

**APP FORECAST**

This project, at the moment, is simply a 'pet guide' for someone looking for a specific type of pet. In the future, I'm hoping to turn it into more of a pet party supply app. Where users will be able to connect, share ideas, & get fun spunky party supplies for their own pet parties. 


Although, my idea was to incorporate all three of my models into this project, It will have to be a reach goal moving forward now. 


This project contains examples of CRUD in React for three models: Users, Pets, and Party.

*Used:*
React, Mongo, Bootstrap, and Material-UI.
